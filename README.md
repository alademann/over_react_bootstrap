# over_react_bootstrap

Bootstrap React UI components built with [OverReact](https://github.com/Workiva/over_react) _(Dartlang)_.

In addition to adding this package as a pub dependency, your `.html` file will need to include the 
bootstrap stylesheet and the react.js scripts in the `<head>` like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    
    <script src="packages/react/react.js"></script>
    <script src="packages/react/react_dom.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

> Use at your own risk until version `1.0.0` is released :)
